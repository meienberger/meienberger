Hello 👋 

I'm Nicolas, a Web Developer from Switzerland with a passion for building things that make life easier. 

Most of my free time is spent building the free and open-source project [Runtipi](https://runtipi.io/). Optimizing and adding new features to make self-hosting simple and reliable.

I sometimes also work and experiment on different other projects that you can find here on my GitHub profile.

I'm open to job opportunities! Feel free to reach out at `jobs@thisprops.com`
